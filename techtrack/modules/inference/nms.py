            - **filtered_scores (List[float])**: The confidence scores of retained bounding boxes.
            - **filtered_class_scores (List[float])**: The class-specific scores of retained boxes.

        **How NMS Works:**
        - The function selects the bounding box with the highest confidence.
        - It suppresses any boxes that have a high IoU (overlapping area) with this selected box.
        - This process is repeated until all valid boxes are retained.

        **Example Usage:**
        ```python
        nms_processor = NMS(score_threshold=0.5, nms_iou_threshold=0.4)
        final_bboxes, final_class_ids, final_scores, final_class_scores = nms_processor.filter(
            bboxes, class_ids, scores, class_scores
        )
        ```
